# JavaScript Variable Scope Assignment

This assignment delves into understanding variable scopes in JavaScript.

## Instructions

1. Open the `variableScope.js` file.
2. Complete the functions as per the instructions provided in each function's comment block.
3. Save the file and run the tests using Jest to verify your implementations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `variableScope.js`.
3. Follow the instructions within each function's comments.
4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
5. Run `npm test` to test your code using Jest.

## Functions to Implement

| Function Name           | Description                                                                    |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `localScopeExample()`   | Declare a variable `localVar` inside the function and return its value.        |
| `globalScopeExample()`  | Access a globally declared variable `globalVar` and return its value.           |
| `blockScopeExample()`   | Use block-level scope to declare a variable `blockVar` and return its value.    |

## Files Included

- `variableScope.js`: Starter file where you will write your code.
- `variableScope.test.js`: Test file to check your implementations using Jest.
